\begin{summary}
  subduction zones -> below water = hard to study
     would be helpfull to have more data
            -> idea : use TID produced by the event in near(semi) field 
    We study the potential of this method to constraint the uplift zone with 30s data 
    Study : Pedernales 2018/04/16 

LEs données 1S apportent quoi en plus ? (idee voir les pointés de temps arivées)

Subduction zones are at the origin of the largest earthquakes and instrumentted them remains difficult because most of them are located under the oceans. Thus, classical onland instrumentation (GPS, seismology, InSAR...) does not allow certain parameters to be well resolved, such as the spatial extent of the rupture or the size of the tsunami that generally follows. One solution could come from studying the disturbances generated in the surrounding ionosphere by the event, earthquake and/or tsunami. These ionospheric disturbances result from coupling between land envelopes and can be tracked even over the oceans using ground-based GPS stations. We studied the potential of these ionospheric signals to constrain vertical uplift zones at the source. We focused in particular on a recent and well-documented earthquake, known as the Pedernales earthquake (Mw 7.8, Ecuador) of April 16, 2016, and whose rupture is mostly undersea.

\unsure[inline]{Based on a parametric study, we show that ionospheric disturbances are mainly sensitive to the maximum uplift zone. But, the parameters of the model to take into account for a fine reconstruction of the observation are, in addition to its location, its initiation time, its amplitude and also the duration of the acoustic pulse associated with the uplift. This sensitivity of ionospheric data suggests an innovative use, especially since the approach is based on an existing, widespread, inexpensive and rapidly expanding technology. }

During the past two decades it became quite common to use Global Navigation Systems (GNSS) to monitor the ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) in order to retrieve the Coseismic-Ionospheric-Disturbance (CID) signal of an earthquake. The method first describe by Calais \& Minster \shortcite{Calais1995} consist in the use of a dual frequency GNSS receiver

% Methodology
%--------------------------------
\section{Modelisation} 
        Idea is to reconstruct the signal assuming N-shape wave produce in 1source point compute the perturbation for multiple receptor and found the acoustic source localisation where the perturbation is reconstructed the best. Following the methods proposed in Rolland et al. (2011,2013) we create an acoustic plane-wave centered on 5 mHz which follows the observed CID see ??? (citation). This wave is an N-shapes waves genreated from a gaussien derivative : 
      The impulse is an acoustic wave of 5 mHz propagating at sound speed, taking account of the attenuation 
        (-> eq N shape)
        (-> eq vitesse déplacement onde)
        
         This  acoustic wave is propagated in the atmosphere with a ray tracing method (citation, J.X. Dessa ?? + see details in quentin Brissaud thesis). Then the interaction between the waves and the atmospheric background is computed. The atmospherics parameters such as air density, temperature and sound speed are derived from NTRL (citation) and the ionosphere background such as electron density is derived from IRI (citation). After that  the perturbation is integrated along the LOS between the SIPP at 180 ? (to discuss : astafyeva 2018, see changes if taking into account a lower boundary) and 500?? km of altitude in order to reconstruct the STEC perturbation. 
        As we plan to test the impact of the satellites position and especially its elevation on the data we kept the STEC instead of converting it to VTEC. 
        
        The main parameters we focused to tune in our work is the impact of the broadening factor in the N-Shape generated waves   

             -> we focused to study the tune of some parameter parameters which one can vary ?

    we models at epicentre and max uplift (hodoseries 1 or multi ?)
    
    \subsection{correlation}
to study the arrival time which assume that the time of maximum perturbation is well reconstruct and so the difference between the time of maximum perturbation in synthetics and observation gives us the delay of the model at one acoustic point source. The most accurate point source \sout{is} should be the one with the most station with small delay.
taking into account that seismological evidence shown that there is approx 30s between the rupture and the uplift ( well maybe thats a bit in advance , is there an article on it ?)

Then grid search around the epicentre from 2~\degree East to 2~\degree West and 2~\degree North to 2~\degree South with a 0.5~\degree step. Which means 81 acoustic source location. With selected b from 0.03 to 0.09 with a 0.01 step see \cite{Astafyeva2011}

In order to select the best parameters we study from three different way the differences and similarities between the model and the synthetics

\subsection{Amplitude factor}

Two methods were used to study the amplitude factor 

first we compare the maximum of STEC perturbation between synthetics and data
then we use for all station and use the root mean square method to obtain the best slopes for each satellite. The best is found for A $^+_-$ 4.5 
the best fit are found on 0.5 step grid with a correlation coefficient of : xx for a broadenning factor between 0.07 and 0.09 and localised xx

the other method is to compare the maximum of correlation between synthetics and observation as :
\begin{equation}
A ~ .~ max(correlation_{synthetics}) =  max(correlation_{observation})
\end{equation}

\todo[caption={discussion},inline]{discussion : As the broadening factor is ill-defined with the first method and as the broadening factor as a not so much impact on the amplitude for a given location we choose to not take it into account to select it (+ see Astafyeva2013)  }


\subsection{Chi2 derived}
\paragraph{Chi2 derived}
\begin{equation}
\chi^2 = \frac{1}{T}\sqrt{\sum_{t=1}^{T}\frac{(O_t-S_t)^2}{O_t^2 + S_t^2}} 
\end{equation}
With T the Total time en t the time of observation. O is the value observe and S the Synthetic value.

we found that the best was at a values of ... for GPS ... x3
other small values from 0... to 0.xx were on the area of lat / lon from the epicenter

We also try to use the mean amplitude factor we first found with A = 5 ,translated in the $\chi^2$ equation as the permutation of $O_t$ by $^5O _t = 5*O_t$. With this approach the smallest $\chi^2$ was found at ... x3 but other small chi in the range ... were found in the area ...

\todo[inline]{do the same with O/max(o) and S/max(S) => it's a quick work}

This method also allow us to compare $\chi2$ over the different broadening factor which sometimes modify the best acoustic source location from 1 step order between 2 following values of broadening factor. Smallests $\chi^2$ are found between b=0.06 and 0.07 but at different location
    
\paragraph{RMS}
  an other $\chi^2$ derived formula to find the best fitting parameters was to use the Root mean square methods \todo[inline]{see Bertrand's paper FMNEAR}  
    \begin{equation}
    RMS= \frac{1}{T}\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{t=1}^{T}(O_t-S_t)^2}{\sum_{t=1}^{T} O_t^2 }} 
    \end{equation}
    
   \subparagraph{CHi2 0.1 degree}
   When zooming between lat : (-1.5:0.1:0.5)
lon(-2:0.1:0.5) with a step 0.1 the area for each GPS is now well define but is still different between two satellite

%_________________________________________________
 \newpage
 \section{supplementaries}
 \subsection{filtering}
 We study the effect of the filtering effect on the synthetics and the observation
 as the wave attenuation is centered on a 5~mHz frequency we try to apply a butter-worth filter around this values. Comparing a 0.5 to 10 mHz to a 2 to 8 mHz filter we saw the model is not able to reconstruct accurately the long-period term of the signal as it was possible for the Van earthquake of magnitude 7.1. the 0.5 to 2 mHz band seems to be able to provides more constraint on strong magnitude earthquake.
